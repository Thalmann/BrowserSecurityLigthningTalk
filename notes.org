* Intro
** Talk about how you better can control your data when using a browser
* The browser
** When you access a website the browser requests all the content 
** So it can show you the content - this is because the browser just loves getting content back ;-)
* The bad content
** Maybe some malicious javascript
** Click on it and you die.. basically
* ScriptBlock
** Demonstration of ScriptBlock on a site -- MAYBE no time
